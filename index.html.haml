      %h2 Shape your data
      %p 
        ModeShape stores data in a tree of nodes and properties,
        in a structure of your design. And just like a file system, you can navigate paths to find related and nested data.
    .span6
      %img{:style=>"max-height: 150px;", :src=>"/images/modeshape-distributed.png", :alt=>"Distribute your data"}
      %h2 Distribute
      %p
        ModeShape uses <a href="http://infinispan.org">Infinispan</a>,
        a superfast, very scalable, highly available in-memory data grid called 
        that distributes data across a cluster of machines and data centers.

      %h2 Validate and evolve
      %p 
        You decide where ModeShape should (if at all) enforce the structure and schema.
        You can even leave room for your data to evolve in a controlled way.
    .span6
      %img{:style=>"max-height: 150px;", :src=>"/images/modeshape-scale-out.png", :alt=>"Scale naturally and easily"}
      %h2 Scale
      %p
        ModeShape is elastic, so you can add more capacity by simply adding more processes
        to the cluster. Scale across data centers to maximize availability.
